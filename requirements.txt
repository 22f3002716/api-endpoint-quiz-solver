# Web Server & Utilities
fastapi
uvicorn[standard] # ASGI server for running FastAPI
pydantic # For data validation and schemas
python-dotenv # For loading environment variables

# Quiz Solver Core
playwright # Headless browser
requests # For general HTTP calls (e.g., fetching data/APIs)
beautifulsoup4 # For HTML content cleaning and parsing

# LLM Orchestration (using Pydantic with an LLM SDK)
# We will choose a standard LLM SDK that works well with Pydantic for structured output.
# We will use the standard Pydantic library for schemas and can integrate a client like the 'google-genai' SDK for the LLM interaction.

# Example LLM client (assuming Gemini or a similar service)
google-genai
# Or for a more generalized approach, you might use 'langchain' or 'instructor' later.
